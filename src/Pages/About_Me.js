                    In my free time, I enjoy making video games, drawing,
                    rock climbing, and playing board games with my friends.
                    I love traveling and nature, and have been hiking and
                    camping across the Americas and Europe. One of my
                    favorite trips I have been on was when I spent a week
                    exploring Arizona and Utah, visiting the Grand Canyon and
                    Zion national park. 
                </p>
            </div>
        );
